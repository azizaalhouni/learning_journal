##Day18
I worked in the about us page in the begining i put the picture in html page
but when I tried to make a hover it didin't work, so  I put them in css that
made the hover work.
#aziza {
  float:right;
  background-image: url('faces/aziza.jpg');
}

#aziza:hover {
  background-image: url('faces/aziza_face.jpg');
}
